We use LSTM networks to forecast the value of
the S&P 500 index, using data from 2010 to the
end of 2023, with daily frequency. Based on the
forecasts from the LSTM model we generate buy
and sell investment signals solely. We verified the
model by testing various of LSTM model combinations and to optimize using in-sample examples and check if there is a problem of overfitting.
Afterward, we employ them in algorithmic investment strategies and test if the LSTM model can
facilitate investment with suitable parameters.
